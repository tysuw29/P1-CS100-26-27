"""Lesson 4 Activity - Refactor the Badge Maker
CS100: Roadmap to Computing

This program already works. Do not change what it prints.

Six blocks below decide six values. FIVE of them are simple two-way
choices and should become one-line ternaries. ONE of them is not -
leave that one alone and write a comment saying why.

Run it once before you touch anything, and save the output. When you
are done, run it again. The two must be identical.

#     Status: Allowed
#     Play:   Active

# =====================================================================
#  RULES
# =====================================================================
#   - Five blocks become one-line ternaries.
#   - One block stays exactly as it is. Add a comment above it saying
#     why a ternary is the wrong tool for that one.
#   - No nested ternaries. If you find yourself writing a second
#     `else` on the same line, that is the block you should have left.
#   - Every ternary fits on one line without wrapping.
# =====================================================================
