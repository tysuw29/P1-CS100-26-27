# 1)

# Print all three and check they still say the same thing.


# ---------- Quick Try 2: break it on purpose ----------
xp = 2500

# This works, but read it out loud first. How long does it take you
# to say what it does?

# Which version would you rather find in someone else's code?


# ---------- Quick Try 3: chained comparison ----------
xp = 800

# Rewrite this using a chained comparison (the variable appears once):
# if xp >= 500 and xp < 1500:
#     print("Silver")
