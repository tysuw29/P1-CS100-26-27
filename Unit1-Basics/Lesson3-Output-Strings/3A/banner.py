Lesson 3A Activity: Tournament Banner
CS100: Roadmap to Computing

Build the banner shown at the bottom of this file.

Everything you need is from today: print(), commas, sep, end, the *
operator, len(), and quote handling. No f-strings - those are next class.

Work top to bottom. Run after every step.
    Right-click in this file -> "Run Python File in Terminal"

Save before you run. Commit and push when your output matches.

# --- Step 1: loading line -------------------------------------
# Two print() calls, ONE line of output.
#   Loading bracket... done
print("Loading bracket..." , end='')
print("Done")

# --- Step 2: header block -------------------------------------
# A border WIDTH wide, the title centered, then another border.
# Calculate the padding from WIDTH and len(title) - don't count
# spaces by hand. Use // so you get a whole number.
print()
print("=" * WIDTH)

padding = (WIDTH - len(title)) // 2
print(" " * padding + title)

print("=" * WIDTH)

# --- Step 3: rounds line --------------------------------------
# Careful: sep goes between EVERY pair, so "Rounds:" would get one
# too. Print the label first with end=" ", then let a second print
# handle the sep.
#   Rounds: Round 1 > Round 2 > Finals
print("Rounds:", end=" ")
print("Round 1", "Round 2", "Finals", sep=" > ")

# --- Step 4: format line --------------------------------------
# Same trap, different fix. This time use ONE print() and fold the
# label into the first item.
#   Format: 8 teams / 7 matches / 2 days
print("Format:", "8 teams", "7 matches", "2 days", sep=" / ")

# --- Step 5: the quote ----------------------------------------
# This line has a double quote AND an apostrophe, so switching the
# outer quote won't save you on its own.
#   Coach said "let's play".
print('Coach said "let\'s play".')

# --- Step 6: closing border -----------------------------------
print()
print("=" * WIDTH)

# STRETCH (optional)

# Change title to your own name. The banner must still center it
# correctly. If it doesn't, you hard-coded the padding.
