Lesson 3B Activity: Match Recap Card
CS100: Roadmap to Computing

Build the recap card shown at the bottom of this file.

New today: f-strings, escape sequences, triple quotes.
Also reuses Part A: sep, end, and the * operator.

Work top to bottom. Run after every step.
Save before you run. Commit and push when your output matches.

# --- Step 1: header block -------------------------------------
# Border, centered title, border. The title is below.
# Calculate the padding - don't count spaces.
title = "MATCH RECAP - VALORANT"
padding = (WIDTH - len(title)) // 2
print("=" * WIDTH)
print(" " * padding + title)
print("=" * WIDTH)

# --- Step 2: player line --------------------------------------
# ONE print() using sep=" | ". Each item is its own f-string.
#   Player: Nova | Rank: Diamond II | Agent: Jett


# --- Step 3: stats lines --------------------------------------
# Rounds uses sep=" > ", K/D/A uses sep=" / ".
# Remember the label trap from last class.
#   Rounds: 13 > 9
#   K/D/A: 24 / 11 / 7


# --- Step 4: accuracy bar -------------------------------------
# A 10-character bar: # for filled, . for empty.
# CALCULATE the filled count from accuracy - do not type the bar
# out by hand. Use // and the * operator, then put both halves
# inside one f-string.
#   Accuracy: ########.. 82%


# --- Step 5: the quote ----------------------------------------
# Both quote types appear, and it needs the player's name inserted.
#   Nova said, "that's my best game."


# --- Step 6: notes block --------------------------------------
# ONE triple-quoted f-string producing every line below, including
# the blank line above "Match Notes:" and the closing border.
# The three indented lines use a TAB escape, not spaces.
# Reminder: triple quotes alone do NOT substitute variables.
#   (blank line)
#   Match Notes:
#       Map: Ascent
#       Duration: 42 min
#       MVP: yes

# STRETCH (optional)
# =============================================================
# Change player, rank, accuracy, and minutes at the top.
# The card must still line up and the bar must still be 10
# characters. If something breaks, you hard-coded a value you
# should have calculated.
